# Pogo-Autotrader
Old Pokemon Go Auto Grinder

Saving this from my old laptop, an auto grinding system I used back in the day when spoofing Pokemon Go. Used pyautogui and MuMu android emulator to use it.

I looked over the code a bit, I think what would happen is that when you trade a Pokemon it gives you a candy, so often people would contact me on Discord to do the max of 100 trades and get free candies. But it took too long and I had to wait for the whole trading animation, so I wrote this program to automate the process on my end. I even connected to a Discord bot to check if it was working remotely. Looking back this was pretty badass lol
